        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>There are basic rules and principles to web design that make websites more appealing, user-friendly and 
            efficient. This is a small sample of how the principles are present in day-to-day browsing on a mobile device.

            <h2 id="hicks">Hick's Law</h2>
            <img src="images/k1a.png" alt="k1a">
            <img src="images/k1b.png" alt="k1a">
            <P>As shown in this website <a href="https://k1speed.com">k1speed</a> they are using Hick's Law, which
                offers few choices to make a decision quicker. Within these two images you can see the that you are
                given a menu a special announcement and then a choice on how you would like to experience your time at
                one of their locations. You are first given a link to locate a track, then individual or group events.
            </P>

            <h2 id="white">White Space</h2>
            <img src="images/gfuel1.png" alt="fuel white 1">
            <img src="images/gfuel2.png" alt="fuel white 2">
            <p>For White Space I am going to yet another shopping site. This time I will be looking at <a
                    href=”https://gfuel.com>gfuel.com </a> and how they use white space in their design. As you can see
                    after their lead image they offer they tag line and a couple of quick links for new arrivals and
                    promotions. Each button is centered and is utilizing white space by padding the text and making that
                    button larger to press, then a simple hyperlink within text. As you scroll down the page you are
                    given some product offers. The image has padding surrounding it and the text also has room to breath
                    on each line with the use of padding. This makes for an easy to read and navigate webpage.</p>

            <h2 id="proxy">Proximity</h2>
            <img src="images/amazon1.png" alt="ama proximity 1">
            <img src="images/amazon2.png" alt="ama proximity 2">
            <p>When looking at Proximity as it relates to design principles I am going to look at <a
                    href=”https//amazon.com>amazon </a> for reference. Here you can see at the top of the page
                    we get an ad for a product then another for a video. Following that are “Today’s deals”
                    which scrolls to the right on various products that are having a sale. As we scroll down, a
                    new section is in place and that is “Overstock deal categories” which is in a grid layout
                    for various item types and then a second set of promotions for overstock items. By doing
                    this all of the items are placed in proximity to each other related to the same promotion.
                    As the page refreshes other categories would be provided and be in proximity to each
                    other.</p>
