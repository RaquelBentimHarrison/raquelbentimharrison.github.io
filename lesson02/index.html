        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>There are basic rules and principles to web design that make websites more appealing, user-friendly and 
            efficient. This is a small sample of how the principles are present in day-to-day browsing on a mobile device.

            <P>The <a href="https://thrivemarket.com">Thrive Market</a> website is a good example of visual hierarchy - 
                is the order in which human eye perceives what it sees. In this case, the viewer will notice the product 
                picture and the "add" button before they even see the price or the full description of the product, making
                it very easy for them to add that product to the cart.

            <h2 id="white">Hick's Law</h2>

            <p>The  <a href=”https://zulily.com></a> Zulily </a>website is one of my most visited. They offer a wide
            range of daily deals that would be hard to sort through, had it not been for the good use of Hick's Law. 
            Hick's Law states that with every additional choice increases the time required to take a decision. So 
            the designers chose to group products in specific categories that many times go beyond brand, showing only
            one category at a time as you scroll down. The viewer can't really go past any one category without reading it and 
            deciding whether or not to click on that collection. </p>

            <p><a href=”https//sweat.com>Sweat </a> is a very popular fitness program amongst women. They include
            a variety of other programs within based on your goals and fitness levels. Each section of their website
        shows a horizontal scroll with a list of programs or routines, are perfectly aligned and contingeous. This 
    is a great example of the Law of Continuity, which states that even when there's an intersection between 
objects, we tend to perceive lines as a continuous uninterrupted entities. </p>
